            <p id="desc" class="gamedesc"><h2 class="cmg-seo-faq-title">Johnny Upgrade Instructions</h2><div class="mobile"><p>Use the on-screen buttons to move around. You can't do anything until you upgrade your powers. You're going to have to memorize what to do and move fast!</p></div><div class="desktop"><p>Use the arrow keys to move around. You're going to have to memorize what to do and move fast! Buy lots of upgrades to beat this one, and make sure that you remember which route is the most efficient to take.&nbsp;</p><p>In Johnny Upgrade, players will have to do exactly what the title says - upgrade! Each round you are given a limited amount of time to travel around the map and collect coins. The round ends when either time runs out, or players run into a trap located somewhere on the map.</p><p>At the end of each round, there is a period where you’re able to make upgrades to your character. There are tons of different upgrades that players can buy using their coins. A few of the main upgrades include getting more time during each round, increasing your speed, and multiplying how much money you get from each coin that you collect.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, players must defeat the final boss at the end of the map. This will require a lot of upgrades, as well as great planning and reactions if players are hoping to beat this fun yet challenging game.</p></div><div class="faqs-list"><h3 class="cmg-seo-faq-title games-like-this">What genre is Johnny Upgrade?</h3><p>Johnny Upgrade is kind of a combination of a lot of different genres, all balled up into one fun and exciting game. It has the components of idle games and business games considering that players will have to manage their coin spending efficiently if they want to do well in the game. On the other hand, players are using these upgrades so they can go through a platformer-styled map that is full of traps meant to get in the way. This combination of so many different genres kind of gives Johnny Upgrade its own unique feel to it.</p><h3 class="cmg-seo-faq-title games-like-this">Are there any games that are similar to Johnny Upgrade?</h3><p>A few games that you probably know that are similar to Johnny Upgrade include Learn to Fly and Tiny Fishing. However, another that you might not know is a new game that we have on the site called Diggy. In Diggy, players are trying to tunnel to the center of the Earth. After players run out of energy each round, they use the points they have earned from digging up valuable items, and purchase items and upgrades to aid them for future rounds. Players upgrade traits such as energy and drilling power in order to make the game easier until they eventually reach the final goal of getting to the center of the Earth.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="cmg-seo-faq-title games-like-this">How long does it take to beat Johnny Upgrade?</h3><p>The record for speedrunning Johnny Upgrade is roughly 6 minutes if no glitches are used. However, we consider under 15 minutes a really great time for this game, even for people who have beaten the game multiple times. For a new player, anything under 45 minutes is a good target to try and hit.</p><p>Most importantly though, just remember to have fun! The time you get doesn’t really matter, what matters is that you have a great time while playing. Johnny Upgrade is an exciting and unique game, so enjoy playing through it and having a blast.</p></div></p>
